# Elevators Simulation

See the included PDF for requirements...

We're simulating elevators.

## Testing

Not going to worry about UI to start with, just doing a simple node CLI.

Testing with tape. Tests are run with `npm test`.

CLI will start a REPL to allow the user to simulate events like users requesting an elevator.

## Notes

Consider whether persisting elevator state is worth considering. Probably not given it is not in the requirements. It would clearly be in a real system.
